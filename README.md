# README for emacsd repository

Need to:

- remove conflicting packages (ivy vs helm, rainbow-delimiters vs
  paredit,  etc).
- C-x C-f file list used to be better (no dired buffers, for a start)
- colour themes have some bad choices (invisible text)

Connected via:

`git remote add origin git@github.com:pauldlynch/emacsd.git
git push -u origin master`

username is pauldlynch, password is the long hex code.

Credit mainly to: Bits from Mastering Emacs, Câ€™est la Z, Uncle Dave,
(cestlaz.github.io/stories/emacs), Emacs and org-mode tutorial
(www.star.bris.ac.uk/bjm/emacs.html) and anywhere else useful.

External requirements (fonts):

- Iosevka, Baskerville (for poet-mode)
- dejavu, inconsolata, roboto?
